Dear Referee,

thank you for your constructive review!

Thank you for pointing out the unclear relation between the formulae by Cahn, KL and Petrov. In my best understanding, all three groups of authors used the same ``starting point'': the additivity of eikonals and the same expression for the Coulomb eikonal. Furthermore, the same ``starting point'' is used for the numerical-integration approach presented in the manuscript. Therefore all 4 methods should give identical results (or at least compatible wrt.~the level of analytic/numerical approximations applied). Indeed, this is the ``clustering'' of results:
\> Cahn, KL and numerical integration: all mutually well compatible,
\> Petrov: incompatible with the above group,

\vskip-3mm
\noindent that hints an inconsistency in the formula by Petrov. An explanatory paragraph has been added to Section 3 (with footnotes detailing the equivalence of the ``starting points'' in the four publications) and another paragraph to the summary in Section 5 (clarifying why to suspect the formula by Petrov).

Thank you for pointing out the language mistakes. Fourier is now spelled with a single r and inverse is used instead of reverse.

For your convenience, a PDF file with ``diff'' in the name is attached to the resubmission -- this file highlights the updates in the manuscript in red.

With best wishes,

Jan Ka\v spar.

\bye
